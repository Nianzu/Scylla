Named after the mythical 6 headed sea monster, Scylla is a multi-agent neural network designed to play chess **like a human** within a given elo range. The design is based on [this paper](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2015/pdfs/ConvChess.pdf) by Barak Oshri and Nishith Khandwala of Stanford University. The novel idea borrowed here is the used of 7 separate neural networks (one for piece selection, and one of each of the 6 pieces in chess). The composition of the piece selection matrix with the highest values from the relevant move selector matrices decides which piece is moved where on a given turn.

## How to play with Scylla
To play with Scylla, [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then download and build this repo with release mode turned on. This will used the pre-trained binaries in `trained_network/`.

```
cargo run --release
```

## How to train Scylla
If you would like to train Scylla yourself, you will have to generate the datasets. The sister program [Scylla_preprocessor](https://github.com/Nianzu/Scylla_preprocessor), will help you do this. Follow the instructions there to generate datasets, then delete the binaries in `trained_network/`, (or just delete the ones you want to retrain) and run Scylla!

For plotters, you will have to install some dependencies on your system.
```
sudo apt install pkg-config libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev
```
